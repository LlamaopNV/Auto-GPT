A User just used AutoGPT to break down and understand AutoGPT

Current Fork was created on 15th of April 2023. 

Overview of current issues : 
============================

Web_browser function improvement.
AI hallucination management system.
Goal-oriented task system.
JSON data handling.
Separate actor for external data access.
Shared database for summarized data.

Thoughts on the current build
==============================


While the current AutoGPT project is impressive, it tends to lose focus on its goals. This fork aims to investigate weak points and build upon the application to assist the original project in becoming a more effective solution.

As GPT-4's full suite of functions becomes available, applications like AutoGPT will become even more powerful. The ability to understand images, for example, would significantly enhance the core offering.

Currently, the web_browser function faces issues with understanding websites and their content. Some examples include:

Receiving a 404 error and interpreting the website as only having information about a 404 error.
Failing to access information that requires user sign-up and considering the URL for sign-up as learned data.
Repeating the same process on the same website while altering the question parameter of the "browse_website" command, leading to inefficiencies and token count issues.
To address these concerns, the following improvements are suggested:

External data access:
Develop a separate actor trained to interpret HTTP response codes and understand website content more effectively.
Consider creating a shared, community-driven database of pre-"chunked" data to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
Implement basic HTTP response understanding, focusing on distinguishing between HTTP 200 - OK and other responses.
Shared Database:
A mutual shared database would benefit the community by providing a core checking point for data and reducing costs through pre-summarized data.
This would require significant effort to establish and maintain but could greatly enhance the AutoGPT ecosystem.

Reason :
The Database would act as a core checking point for a data point, for example lets say I am training an AutoGPT to be an assistant on the OpenAI API so it can just quikcly answer my questions on an API query. 

If we had a shared community Database we could reduce costs greatly by just checking the database first and already having summarized data. Users could all benefit form such a Dataset but granted this would be a mamouth task. 


Roadmap for AutoGPT Fork Improvements:
======================================

Brief overview of the improvements:
===================================
Improve the web_browser function, manage AI hallucination, implement a goal-oriented task system, enhance JSON data handling, develop a separate actor for external data access, and explore a shared database for summarized data.

Selected solutions and descriptions:
====================================

a. Web_browser function improvement:
Develop a separate actor that can interpret HTTP response codes and understand website content more effectively.

b. AI hallucination management system:
Implement a task validation mechanism to check genuine task completion and incorporate feedback loops for learning.

c. Goal-oriented task system:
Establish a priority-based task allocation system and introduce resource budgets for each task.

d. JSON data handling:
Improve JSON parsing with error-handling routines, data validation, and a unified data structure.

e. Separate actor for external data access:
Create an actor that handles HTTP responses and manages data access more efficiently.

f. Shared database for summarized data:
Investigate the feasibility of a community-driven, shared database for pre-"chunked" and summarized data.

Task breakdown:
===============

a. Web_browser function improvement:
Design and implement a separate actor for data access.
Train the actor on handling HTTP response codes and website content understanding.
Integrate the actor with the existing system.

b. AI hallucination management system:
Design a task validation mechanism.
Implement human validation, if feasible.
Incorporate feedback loops to improve AI learning.

c. Goal-oriented task system:
Develop a priority-based task allocation system.
Assign weights to goal-relevant tasks.
Set resource budgets for each task.

d. JSON data handling:
Add error-handling routines and data validation to JSON parsing.
Implement a unified data structure.
Consider using a JSON parsing library or custom parsers.

e. Separate actor for external data access:
Build and train a specialized agent to handle external data access.
Implement basic HTTP response understanding.
Integrate the agent into the existing system.

f. Shared database for summarized data:
Assess the feasibility and interest within the community for a shared database.
Design the database schema and structure.
Develop a system for users to contribute to and access the database.

Timeline for completing the tasks:
==================================
Months 1-2: Web_browser function improvement and JSON data handling.
Months 3-4: AI hallucination management system and goal-oriented task system.
Months 5-6: Develop a separate actor for external data access.
Months 7-9: Investigate the feasibility of a shared database and begin implementation if deemed viable.

List of required resources:
===========================
Libraries: JSON parsing libraries, machine learning libraries (if applicable), and any other libraries required for specific tasks.
Tools: Development environment, version control (e.g., Git), project management tools, and testing frameworks.
APIs: Google Custom Search API or other APIs required for data access.
Community engagement: Platforms for discussing the shared database idea and gathering feedback.
